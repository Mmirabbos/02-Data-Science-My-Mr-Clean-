# Scrapping WEB site wikipedia

## In this code, more precisely, in jupyter note book, I fixed everything, added all the necessary functions and supplemented them with small lambda functions, added more stop words for accuracy, turned them into json format and made them in lowercase for equality and for accuracy of calculations

## I'll leave all the necessary libraries for this code at the bottom for convenience

``` python
    pip3 install ssl
    pip3 install requests
    pip3 install bs4
    pip3 install matplotlib
    pip3 install numpy
    pip3 install nltk
```

## Library info

Computers sometimes ask for SSL access and to avoid this we need an `ssl` library
We need a request to send a `request` to the site
We need `Bs4` to find information
We need `Matplotlib` to output the diagram 
`Numpy` For convenience
`Nltk` for stop words

## Info

`
Each function was added and fixed by me personally. The previous code had some flaws with the functions, but in this code everything works as clearly as possible
